      <h2>Challenge 3 - Create a Form</h2>
      <form>

        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
        <label for="mname">Middle name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="mname" name="mname"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br>

        <label for="btn">A button!</label><br>
        <input type="button" name="btn" value=""><br>
        <label for="chk">And a checkbox!!!</label><br>
        <input type="checkbox" name="chk" value=""><br>

      </form>

        <h2>Challenge 5 - Accessibility</h2>
        <form>
          <p>None of the provided form options would be accessible to sightless people, since they all convey their information visually. People who do not have full use of their limbs, or who are missing limbs, would also have a hard time interacting with the form, since it may be hard to have a text to speech or other assistive system enter information into it. The form also does not support people who cannot read english, including people from countries that speak other languages, small children, and the otherwise illiterate. The button and checkbox are also rather small, and someone with a condition that impairs their fine motor skills, such as severe arthritis or parkinsons, might have difficulty positioning the mouse overtop these elements so as to click on them.</p>
